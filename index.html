	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>Hello, I am Cristian. I've been working in television for the past 3 years, but Im currently attending the Coding Bootcamp at UCLA Extension. As competition arises in the entertainment industry, I decided I wanted to make a career change, and started learning HTML and CSS on my own, and then decided to join the bootcamp on fall of 2016.</p>
	<p>After doing plenty of research I came to the conclusion that becoming a developer not only would fit with my personality, but it will also allow me to become location independent, and financially free, so I can trave; the world.</p>
